Device Type      : HP DeskJet Printer
Model            : DeskJet 2600 Series (based on web panel)
IP Address       : 72.199.200.5
Port             : 80 (HTTP)
Shodan Query     : http.title:"HP" port:80
Geo-location     : United States
Date Discovered  : June 2025
Access Control   : None (no login required)
CVE Details.     : CVE-2021-39237
[3] WEB INTERFACE OBSERVATIONS
-------------------------------
- Login page skipped (open admin panel)
- Network SSID exposed: Cakera
- WAN IP: 78.142.23.171 | LAN IP: 192.168.100.1
- MAC Addresses (WAN): C4:6E:1F:3B:E7:E2
- DHCP client list shows multiple devices
